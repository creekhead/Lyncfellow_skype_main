# LyncFellow_skype - A small app/interface to use with the LyncFellow ibuddy, a small robotic toy/device from mid 2000's
This code integrated the iBuddy with Skype for Buysiness, it allows all the actions the iBuddy can do as well as some sype actions, it can show the current status on Skype in different colors and emotions<br/>



<b>Notes:</b>Originally designed in VS 2015 / Verified in 2019 both Community Editions - Skype needs to be running in order for it to execute properly
<br/>
<b>This was just for fun and learning, no longer being maintained</b>
PS. Iam sure it needs debugging it is a VERY rought application and has some issues, we no longer use Skype for Business so the dev has stopped for now, but i might tweak it for Teams instead one day
